This project aims to optimize the bike and rack allocation for the CitiBike system in Jersey City, using demand prediction and mathematical modeling to reduce shortages, surpluses, and operational transfer costs. It was developed as part of the IE469 Industrial Applications of Operations Research course at Bilkent University.

Methodology:

Modeled station usage with non-homogeneous Poisson processes for hourly inflows and outflows.

Designed an optimization-based decision framework for rebalancing using:

Transfer cost minimization

Shortage/surplus penalty handling

Time delays between stations for transfer availability

Performed a present worth cost analysis to evaluate:

Bike purchase investments

Rack capacity expansions

Created a VBA form interface in Excel to dynamically test scenarios and generate real-time feedback.
